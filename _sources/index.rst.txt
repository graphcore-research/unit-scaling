Unit Scaling
============

**Warning:** this library is currently in its _alpha_ release. This means it is
unoptimised and missing important functionality. We hope users still find the
library valuable, but it should not be expected to work seamlessly. We are keen to
help early users with any problems they encounter.

Welcome to the :code:`unit-scaling` library. This library is designed to facilitate
the use of the *unit scaling* method, as outlined in the paper
`Unit Scaling: Out-of-the-Box Low-Precision Training (ICML, 2023)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11257>`_.

We recommend that new users get started with our :ref:`User Guide`.

For a high-level overview of the technique, see
