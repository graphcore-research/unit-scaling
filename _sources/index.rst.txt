Unit Scaling
============

Welcome to the :code:`unit-scaling` library. This library is designed to facilitate
the use of the *unit scaling* method, as outlined in the paper
`Unit Scaling: Out-of-the-Box Low-Precision Training (ICML, 2023)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11257>`_.

For a demonstration of the library, see `Out-of-the-Box FP8 Training
<https://github.com/graphcore-research/out-of-the-box-fp8-training/blob/main/out_of_the_box_fp8_training.ipynb>`_ â€” a notebook showing how to unit-scale the nanoGPT model.
