Unit Scaling
============

Welcome to the :code:`unit-scaling` library. This library is designed to facilitate
the use of the *unit scaling* and *u-µP* methods, as outlined in the papers
`Unit Scaling: Out-of-the-Box Low-Precision Training (ICML, 2023)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11257>`_ and
`u-μP: The Unit-Scaled Maximal Update Parametrization
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17465>`_

For a demonstration of the library, see `u-μP using the unit_scaling library
<https://github.com/graphcore-research/unit-scaling/blob/main/examples/demo.ipynb>`_ — a notebook showing the definition and training of a u-µP language model, comparing against Standard Parametrization (SP).

.. Note:: The library is currently in its *beta* release.
    Some features have yet to be implemented and occasional bugs may be present.
    We're keen to help users with any problems they encounter.

`The following slides <https://github.com/graphcore-research/unit-scaling/blob/main/docs/u-muP_slides.pdf>`_ also give an overview of u-µP.
